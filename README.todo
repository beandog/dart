* Run qa after Handbrake runs -- check if the Matroska file has the video tracks and audio tracks I was expecting
* capture SIGINT and do cleanup
* dart.encode.php, see FIXME note -- sets copy, faac by default, completely ignoring preferences in database
* Do verbosity checks throughout, use levels
* For debugging, echo command lines run to a 'debug' file or directory somewhere
